In this project, I am building a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page that links to a collection of individual recipe pages. Each recipe will include a title, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish. This project will help me practice and demonstrate foundational web development skills, including HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and possibly JavaScript for enhancing functionality.
